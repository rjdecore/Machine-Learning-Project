# Spam SMS Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam SMS messages. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and potential improvements.

## Project Structure

- **spam.csv:** Contains the dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
- **spam_detection.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- **vectorizer.pkl:** Pickle file containing the trained TfidfVectorizer.
- **model.pkl:** Pickle file containing the trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
- **README.md:** This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab



## Usage

1. Open the `spam_detection.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
3. Use the trained model to predict the spam or ham status of new SMS messages.

## Model Performance

The Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of approximately 98% and a precision of approximately 99%.

## Improvements

- Explore other machine learning models.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Incorporate more data for training.
- Build a web interface for real-time spam detection.
